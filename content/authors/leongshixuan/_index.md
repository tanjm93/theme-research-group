## Biography

<div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px;">
Shi Xuan did B.Sc. in Chemistry with the CN Yang Scholars Programme where she performed various research stints (should I mention working with Soo Han Sen, Martin Pumera and overseas FYP with Frank Marken . Also mentioned the MIT-SMART programme then).

She then pursued her Ph.D. in Chemistry at Nanyang Technological University with Prof. Ling Xing Yi. Her graduate research was supported by the Nanyang President's Graduate Scholarship, focusing on the development of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) platforms for detection at the nano-bio interface.

To expand her expertise in automation and data driven discovery, Shi Xuan conducted postdoctoral research in Professor Alán Aspuru-Guzik's group at University of Toronto under the Singapore Teaching and Academic Research Talent (START) scheme, where she worked with vision-language models and scientific agentic systems for data digitization and computational chemistry.

Shi Xuan joined the School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology at Nanyang Technological University as an Assistant Professor in October 2025. Shi Xuan was the recipient of the DAAD AInet Fellowship (2024), the Dr and Mrs Alex Tan Pang Kee gold medal (2023), the Goh Lai Yoong Award (2023), and the SNIC-Prof Lee Soo Ying Young Chemist Silver Award (2023).
